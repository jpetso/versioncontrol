/**
 * Retrieve a set of repositories if they match the given constraints. If no

 *
 * @param $constraints
 *   An optional array of constraints. Possible array elements are:
 *
 *   'vcs': An array of strings, like array('cvs', 'svn', 'git').
 *          If given, only commits for these backends will be returned.
 *   'repo_ids': An array of repository ids.
 *               If given, only the corresponding repositories will be returned.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of repositories where the key of each element is the
 *   repository id. The corresponding value contains a structured array
 *   with the following keys:
 *
 *   'repo_id': The unique repository id.
 *   'name': The user-visible name of the repository.
 *   'vcs': The unique string identifier of the version control system
 *          that powers this repository.
 *   'root': The root directory of the repository. In most cases,
 *           this will be a local directory (e.g. '/var/repos/drupal'),
 *           but it may also be some specialized string for remote repository
 *           access. How this string may look like depends on the backend.
 *   'url_view' and 'url_diff': Not meant to be used directly, please refer
 *       to the versioncontrol_get_url_view() and versioncontrol_get_url_diff()
 *       functions if you need this functionality.
 *
 *   Additional elements may be added by specific version control system backends.

 *   'commit_id_lower': A commit id. If given, the result set will not contain
 *                      commits earlier than this lower bound. Mind that
 *                      commit ids only correspond to chronological order

 *   'date_upper': A Unix timestamp. If given, the result set will not contain
 *                 commits later than this upper bound.

 *                     looks like is defined by the corresponding backend
 *                     module ([xxx]_backend). Other backend modules won't

 *   'repository': The repository where this commit occurred.
 *                 This is a structured array, like a single element of
