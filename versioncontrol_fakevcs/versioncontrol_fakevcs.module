 *   more accurately or with better performance. Version Control API passes a

 *   - 'source_item': The @p $other_item is a predecessor of the
 *        @p $target_item - same entity, but in an earlier revision and
 *        potentially with a different path, too (only if the backend supports
 *        item moves).
 *   - 'successor_item': The @p $other_item is a successor of the
 *        @p $target_item - same entity, but in a later revision and
 *        potentially with a different path, too (only if the backend supports
 *        item moves).
 *   - 'same_revision': The @p $other_item is at the same (global) revision
 *        as the @p $target_item. Specifically meant for backends whose
 *        version control systems don't support atomic commits.
 *
 * @return
 *   NULL if the given item does not belong to any label or if an appropriate
 *   label cannot be retrieved. Otherwise a label array is returned, consisting
 *   of the following elements:
 *
 *   - 'name': The branch or tag name (a string).
 *   - 'type': Whether this label is a branch (indicated by the

 *             (VERSIONCONTROL_OPERATION_TAG).
 *
 *   NULL is returned if the given item is not under version control,
 *   or was not under version control at the time of the given revision.

/**
 * Implementation of [versioncontrol_backend]_operation():

 * by a cron script when the actual commit/branch/tag has been accomplished
 * for quite a while already.
 *
 * This function is optional for backend modules to implement. If you don't
 * need custom operation data, just don't implement it.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   'insert' when the operation has just been recorded and inserted into the
 *   database, or 'delete' if it will be deleted right after this hook
 *   has been called.
 *
 * @param $operation
 *   An operation array containing basic information about the commit, branch
 *   or tag operation. It consists of the following elements:
 *
 *   - 'vc_op_id': The Drupal-specific operation identifier (a simple integer)
 *        which is unique among all operations (commits, branch ops, tag ops)
 *        in all repositories.
 *   - 'type': The type of the operation - one of the
 *        VERSIONCONTROL_OPERATION_{COMMIT,BRANCH,TAG} constants.
 *        Note that if you pass branch or tag constraints, this function might
 *        nevertheless return commit operations too - that happens for version
 *        control systems without native branches or tags (like Subversion)
 *        when a branch or tag is affected by the commit.
 *   - 'repository': The repository where this operation occurred.
 *        This is a structured "repository array", like is returned
 *        by versioncontrol_get_repository().
 *   - 'date': The time when the operation was performed, given as
 *        Unix timestamp. (For commits, this is the time when the revision
 *        was committed, whereas for branch/tag operations it is the time
 *        when the files were branched or tagged.)
 *   - 'uid': The Drupal user id of the operation author, or 0 if no
 *        Drupal user could be associated to the author.
 *   - 'username': The system specific VCS username of the author.
 *   - 'message': The log message for the commit, tag or branch operation.
 *        If a version control system doesn't support messages for any of them,
 *        this element contains an empty string.
 *   - 'revision': The VCS specific repository-wide revision identifier,
 *        like '' in CVS, '27491' in Subversion or some SHA-1 key in various
 *        distributed version control systems. If there is no such revision
 *        (which may be the case for version control systems that don't support
 *        atomic commits) then the 'revision' element is an empty string.
 *        For branch and tag operations, this element indicates the
 *        (repository-wide) revision of the files that were branched or tagged.
 *
 *   - 'labels': An array of branches or tags that were affected by this
 *        operation. Branch and tag operations are known to only affect one
 *        branch or tag, so for these there will be only one element (with 0
 *        as key) in 'labels'. Commits might affect any number of branches,
 *        including none. Commits that emulate branches and/or tags (like
 *        in Subversion, where they're not a native concept) can also include
 *        add/delete/move operations for labels, as detailed below.
 *        Mind that the main development branch - e.g. 'HEAD', 'trunk'
 *        or 'master' - is also considered a branch. Each element in 'labels'
 *        is a structured array with the following keys:
 *
 *        - 'id': The label identifier (a simple integer), used for unique
 *             identification of branches and tags in the database.
 *        - 'name': The branch or tag name (a string).
 *        - 'action': Specifies what happened to this label in this operation.
 *             For plain commits, this is always VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_MODIFIED.
 *             For branch or tag operations (or commits that emulate those),
 *             it can be either VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_ADDED or
 *             VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_DELETED.
 *
 * @param $operation_items
 *   A structured array containing all items that were affected by the above
 *   operation. Array keys are the current/new paths, even if the item doesn't
 *   exist anymore (as is the case with delete actions in commits).
 *   The associated array elements are structured item arrays and consist of
 *   the following elements:
 *
 *   - 'type': Specifies the item type, which is either
 *        VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_FILE or VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_DIRECTORY for items
 *        that still exist, or VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_FILE_DELETED respectively
 *        VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_DIRECTORY_DELETED for items that have been
 *        removed (by a commit's delete action).
 *   - 'path': The path of the item at the specific revision.
 *   - 'revision': The (file-level) revision when the item was changed.
 *        If there is no such revision (which may be the case for
 *        directory items) then the 'revision' element is an empty string.
 *   - 'item_revision_id': Identifier of this item revision in the database.
 *        Note that you can only rely on this element to exist for
 *        operation items - functions that interface directly with the VCS
 *        (such as versioncontrol_get_directory_contents() or
 *        versioncontrol_get_parallel_items()) might not include
 *        this identifier, for obvious reasons.
 *
 *   For commit operations, additional information about the origin of
 *   the items is also available. The following elements will be set
 *   for each item in addition to the ones listed above:
 *
 *   - 'action': Specifies how the item was changed.
 *        One of the predefined VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_* values.
 *   - 'source_items': An array with the previous state(s) of the affected item.
 *        Empty if 'action' is VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_ADDED.
 *   - 'replaced_item': The previous but technically unrelated item at the
 *        same location as the current item. Only exists if this previous item
 *        was deleted and replaced by a different one that was just moved
 *        or copied to this location.
